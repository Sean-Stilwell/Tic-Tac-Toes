# Java Tic-Tac-Toe Implementation

This is the basic implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe that I created. This implementation is designed using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) concept. This code is also used as a basis for my Tic-Tac-Toe Android application, which is run using Java.

Files included in this repository:

* Board.java - Contains the model and logic for the board, which can then be interpreted and displayed.

* Play.java - A basic text-based implementation of the game, where the user uses coordinates to place their move.
